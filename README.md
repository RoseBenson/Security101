## Description

In this project I worked on a super security password generator. This password generator endevors to give you a series of prompts allowing you to specify the type of password you would like. From choosing if you would like upper or lowercase, to allowing you to choose the length or even specify for special characters. This app uses different technologies to allow for an interactive experience for the user.
